// https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/

/**
 * All houses are arranged in a circle. Given an array where nums[i] is the
 * money at house i, return the maximum you can rob without robbing two
 * adjacent houses (first and last are also adjacent).
 *
 * Example 1: nums = [2,3,2] -> 3 (cannot rob first and last)
 * Example 2: nums = [1,2,3,1] -> 4
 * Example 3: nums = [1,2,3] -> 3
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - Houses form a circle: first and last are adjacent
 * - Cannot rob two adjacent houses
