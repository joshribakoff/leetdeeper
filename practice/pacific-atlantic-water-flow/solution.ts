// Pacific Atlantic Water Flow - Leetcode 417
// https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/
/**
 * Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of
 * each cell, return a list of coordinates where water can flow to both the
 * Pacific ocean (top/left edges) and Atlantic ocean (bottom/right edges).
 * Water can flow from a cell to an adjacent cell with equal or lower height.
 *
 * Example 1: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]] -> [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
 * Example 2: heights = [[1]] -> [[0,0]]
