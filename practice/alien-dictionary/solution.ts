// LeetCode 269: Alien Dictionary
// Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, derive the order of letters.

/**
 * Given a list of words sorted lexicographically by the rules of a new alien
 * language, derive the order of letters in that language. Return "" if invalid.
 *
 * Example 1: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"] -> "wertf"
 * Example 2: words = ["z","x"] -> "zx"
 * Example 3: words = ["z","x","z"] -> "" (invalid order)
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - If order is invalid, return ""
 * - A longer word appearing before its prefix is invalid
