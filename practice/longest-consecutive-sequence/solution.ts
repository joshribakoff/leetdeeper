// Longest Consecutive Sequence - Leetcode 128
// https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
/**
 * Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the
 * longest consecutive elements sequence. Must run in O(n) time.
 *
 * Example 1: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] -> 4 (sequence is [1,2,3,4])
 * Example 2: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] -> 9
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - Must run in O(n) time
