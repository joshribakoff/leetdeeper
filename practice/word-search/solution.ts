// Word Search - Leetcode 79
// Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
// The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells.
/**
 * Given an m x n grid of characters and a string word, return true if
 * the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters
 * of sequentially adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically). The same
 * cell may not be used more than once.
 *
 * Example 1: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED" -> true
 * Example 2: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE" -> true
 * Example 3: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB" -> false
