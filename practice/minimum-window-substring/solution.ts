// Minimum Window Substring - Leetcode 76
// Given strings s and t, return the minimum window substring of s
// that contains all characters of t (including duplicates).
/**
 * Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window substring of s such
 * that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
 * Return "" if no such substring exists.
 *
 * Example 1: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC" -> "BANC"
 * Example 2: s = "a", t = "a" -> "a"
 * Example 3: s = "a", t = "aa" -> ""
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The answer is unique when it exists
