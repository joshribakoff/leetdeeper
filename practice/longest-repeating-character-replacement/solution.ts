// Longest Repeating Character Replacement - Leetcode 424
// Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring
// containing the same letter you can get after performing at most k character replacements.
/**
 * Given a string s and an integer k, you can choose any character and change
 * it to any other uppercase English letter at most k times. Return the length
 * of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing at
 * most k replacements.
 *
 * Example 1: s = "ABAB", k = 2 -> 4
 * Example 2: s = "AABABBA", k = 1 -> 4
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - s consists of only uppercase English letters
