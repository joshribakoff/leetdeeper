// https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
/**
 * Given a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot, search for
 * a target value. Return its index, or -1 if not found.
 * Must run in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Example 1: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 -> 4
 * Example 2: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3 -> -1
 * Example 3: nums = [1], target = 0 -> -1
