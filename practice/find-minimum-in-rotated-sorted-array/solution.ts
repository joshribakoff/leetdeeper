// Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - Leetcode 153
// https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

/**
 * Given a sorted array of unique elements that has been rotated between 1 and
 * n times, find the minimum element. Must run in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Example 1: nums = [3,4,5,1,2] -> 1
 * Example 2: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] -> 0
 * Example 3: nums = [11,13,15,17] -> 11 (not rotated)
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - All elements are unique
 * - Must be O(log n)
