// Longest Common Subsequence - Leetcode 1143
// https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/
/**
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest
 * common subsequence. A subsequence is derived by deleting some (or no)
 * characters without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * Example 1: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" -> 3 (LCS is "ace")
 * Example 2: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc" -> 3
 * Example 3: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def" -> 0
